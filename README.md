# proibid-o-pong

classic game called "pong" with a brazilian song wich style is "funk proibid√£o"... that style of music speak of criminality on the gueto.
i just put that song because its a meme here in Brazil. 
i dont commit crime, or support criminality. 
It's just a joke that people from Brazil will surely understand!
